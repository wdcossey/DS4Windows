# TODO

* Add hooks to keep track of active display monitors for Absolute Mouse
* Figure out desired options for Absolute Mouse support
* Add absolute mouse options for various output types (Sticks and Touchpad)
* Add more localization ready strings
* Try to add some form of Action Set support. Really missing playing Mass Effect 1 and 2
* Experiment with XmlSerializer class for reading Profiles.xml data
* Re-check Switch Pro and JoyCon rumble frequency interpretation
* Attempt to add stick delta acceleration for mouse output. Kind of missing that option from my old experiments
